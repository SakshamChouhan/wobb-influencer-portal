# Component Architecture and State Management

## Overview

This document outlines the component structure, state management approach, and data flow used in the Wobb Influencer Portal redesign. The application follows React best practices with a component-based architecture and efficient state management.

## Component Structure

The application follows a hierarchical component structure:

```
App
└── Router
    ├── Header
    └── Home
        ├── FilterSection
        │   └── FilterChip
        ├── CampaignGrid
        │   └── CampaignCard
        │       ├── Brand Information
        │       ├── Campaign Details
        │       └── Progress Indicator
        └── Pagination
```

### Key Components

#### App Component

The root component that sets up the application's routing and global providers.

**Responsibility**:
- Provides the query client provider for data fetching
- Sets up the application router
- Renders the main application layout

#### Header Component

A fixed navigation component that appears at the top of the application.

**Responsibility**:
- Displays the application branding
- Provides search functionality
- Shows user navigation options

#### Home Component

The main page component that serves as the landing page.

**Responsibility**:
- Manages the list of campaigns
- Handles filtering and search logic
- Manages pagination state

#### FilterChip Component

Individual filter options that can be toggled on/off.

**Responsibility**:
- Displays a category filter option
- Handles selection state
- Communicates selection changes to parent components

#### CampaignCard Component

Card presentation of an individual campaign.

**Responsibility**:
- Displays all campaign information in a visually appealing format
- Shows brand details
- Displays payout information
- Renders hiring progress

#### Pagination Component

Navigation component for moving between pages of results.

**Responsibility**:
- Displays current page information
- Provides navigation to other pages
- Adjusts display based on available space

## State Management

The application uses a combination of local component state and React Query for efficient state management.

### Local State

React's `useState` and `useReducer` hooks are used for managing component-specific state:

- **Filter Selection**: Managed in the Home component
- **Search Query**: Managed in the Header component
- **Current Page**: Managed in the Home component
- **UI States** (hover, focus, etc.): Managed within individual components

### Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. User interactions (clicks, inputs) trigger event handlers
2. Event handlers update state via state setters
3. State changes cause components to re-render with new data
4. Child components receive data and callbacks as props

## Custom Hooks

The application includes custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic:

### `useIsMobile`

A responsive utility hook that detects when the viewport is in mobile size.

**Usage**:
- Allows components to adapt their rendering based on screen size
- Handles window resize events efficiently with debouncing

## Performance Optimizations

Several strategies are employed to ensure optimal performance:

### Memoization

- `React.memo` is used for pure components that don't need to re-render when parent components change
- `useMemo` is used for expensive calculations
- `useCallback` is used for event handlers passed to child components

### Virtualization

For long lists, virtualization could be implemented to render only visible items, reducing DOM size and improving performance.

### Code Splitting

The application can be configured for code splitting to load components only when needed, reducing initial load time.

## Error Handling

The application implements a robust error handling strategy:

- React Error Boundaries catch rendering errors
- Try/catch blocks handle operational errors
- Fallback UI for failed components

## Future Architecture Considerations

As the application grows, these architectural changes could be considered:

### State Management Evolution

For more complex state requirements, a dedicated state management library like Redux or Zustand could be integrated.

### Component Library

As the UI grows, a more formalized component library with Storybook documentation could be developed.

### Backend Integration

The current application uses mock data, but it's designed to easily connect to a backend API when available.
